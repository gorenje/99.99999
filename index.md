<h2>The Seven Nines of Insignificance</h2>
</div>

Global perspective:

*It helps to bear in mind that about 99.9999% of the worlds population have no awareness of your existence.* - [Digit-Al on Hacker News (HN)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30231627)

Universal perspective:

*We are insignificant and meaningless. Just look at that data. We live on a planet that's billions of years old in a solar system that's probably even older. Currently each one of us is but one of almost 8 billion others currently alive right now. One day you will die with millions of others. Not long after that, anyone that had a memory of you will die. You will be completely erased.* - [skinney6 on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30233933)

Both of these comments were in response to the question *[How do you deal with getting old and feeling lost?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30230620)*. Unsurprisingly a similar question [*Turned 44 today and I'm lost*](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31028795) appeared a little time later.

Ninety-Nine-Point-Nine-Nine-Nine-Nine percent of the worlds population aren't aware of your existence. Rounding this up to the next whole number: one hundred percent.

It's hard **not** to feel lost when faced with the cold facts.

## Lost in a World of Numbers

But what are the actual numbers? How many followers does someone need to move the gauge? If we take a total population of 8 billion people then:

- 99% represents 80 million, meaning: if you have 80 million followers, then only 99% of the worlds population *would not* be aware of your existence.
- 99.9% represents 8 million followers. So under 80 million and it's already 99.9% of the worlds population doesn't know of your existence.
- 99.99% represents 800 thousand followers
- 99.999% represents 80 thousand followers
- 99.9999% represents 8 thousand followers
- 99.99999% represents 800 followers

Since we are talking about people who know of your existence not people that know each other, this makes followers a good indicator of people who are potentially aware of your existence but you not of theirs.

Of course, here the question can be raised whether you are aware of a followers existence if they start to follow you? I would say no. Since *being* followed is not an active action by the person being followed. It is an active act by the person who started to follow. Hence that person has become aware of your existence. (Bots don't count ...)

So just to crack the [five nines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_nines), you will need at least 80 thousand followers. I would say the vast majority of humankind are somewhere between six nines and seven nines.

Seven Nines of Insignificance.

It does beg the question: who is the *least unknown* (or *most known* for those who don't like double negations) person on the planet? Dead or alive? Obviously religious figures such as Buddha or Jesus would be up there. But perhaps also the [The Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_popular_than_Jesus).

So we if assume that 400 million people currently living know of The Beatles, then only 95% of the worlds population would be *unaware* of The Beatles. On the other hand, Buddha is probably known to most Thais, Indians, Chinese, .... Let us assume 2 billion people living today know of Buddha. Then 75% of the worlds population would be *unaware* of Buddha ever having existed.

On the other hand, the *least known* person is far simpler: you and me. Or rather a very large percentage of the worlds population is probably equally unknown. So there is a good chance that you and me are *least known* people.

## Life, the Universe and Everything

But we can all take solace in the fact that there are, according to estimations, up to [400 billion](https://skiesandscopes.com/how-many-planets/) planets in the Milky Way. That's not the Universe, just the Milky Way.

And at the moment, the Earth has zero *known* followers. I guess we could start talking about *dark* followers - in the sense of dark matter that does not interact with anything and can't be measured but apparently exists. But dark followers *really* don't count i.e. if the planet does not it's being followed then it also doesn't make a difference.

So that means that our planet is even more unknown than anyone living on the planet. And take comfort, that is not to say that there isn't someone somewhere in the Milky Way that is even more least known than you and me - we just don't know of them.

So realising that the Earth is far more insignificant than ourselves might provide some comfort for our own insignificance.

## Solace in the concept of God

Please note, I am discussing the *concept* of "God", I am not discussing a *particular* or *specific* incarnation of that concept, that is, believe in your God and be open to discussion on the *concept* of "God". To make this distinction clearer I'll use *Great Maker in the Sky* - GMitS instead of "God".

Let us assume there is an omnipresent GMitS, who is really interested in what we do and who we are. This GMitS has our best intentions at heart and offers us a prize for getting through life. That prize is to live in everlasting love, peace and harmony in a place called "heaven". Of course this being a prize, it's only awarded to the best amongst us. So only the "good" (judged by a specific set of rules - lets call them "the ten commandments") make it to heaven. What happens to the "bad" ones we don't really want to know - it's really bad. (Psychologically speaking it is better for everyone to have their own personal hell. A general hell might be appealing and/or pleasant for some and that would make hell to heaven for those so inclined.)

Now imagine encountering an anthill. This comparison is based on the fact that the ants have about as much understanding of us as we do of our GMitS. We assume that ants have also developed the concept of "GMitS" and we have taken on the role of their GMitS.

Every time an ant dies, it becomes our job to decide whether this was a "good" ant or a "bad" ant. Another job that we have to do is listen to anything these ants say to us - lets call this communication "prayers". We need to store all their communication with us in a big book so that we can better judge whether this was a good or bad ant. On top of this, we also have to read their minds - even bad thoughts count against an ant!

In addition to that, we have to keep an eye on their behaviour - are they behaving well to their fellow ants?

That's a lot of spying and eavesdropping - it would nice we could digitalise all this ...

And now imagine the ant. Do you think the ant understands that it's being punished by GMitS if we happen to step on it? I doubt that very much. And are we punishing the ant or did we simply not notice the ant? I really have a hard time trying to figure out why I would want to punish an ant. Ok, this is assuming the ant is in its natural habitat and not in my kitchen.

So I'd rather doubt that there is an omnipresent "GMitS" that somehow has our best intentions at heart. Or if there is, then similar to an ant, this "GMitS" does not directly influence my day-to-day life and when he does, e.g. steps on me, I have no comprehension that it was "GMitS" or why it happened.

So, personally, the concept of "GMitS" does not really help me to deal with my insignificance. But it does do something for my level of humour.

## Butterflies and rice sacks - Causality to the rescue

If the rice sack falls in China does it affect me? If a tree falls in the forest and there is no one there to hear it, does it make a sound?

Do the [wings of butterflies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect) cause tornados?

Causality is the concept that small actions can generate large effects. In this sense, how can we *possibly* be insignificant? Does not everyone cause things to happen and thus triggering larger effects?

Yes we do. Each of us interact with the outside world and cause things to happen. However, there are very many indirect events that we aren't directly associate with ourselves. Sure we could say that my favourite sporting team won because *I* was there to cheer them on - without me, they would never have won.

Or my vote caused the election to swing one way or another. In fact that's why elections are anonymous - to give everyone that feeling that they made a difference. The truth is rather different. Very few seats are swing seats and very few people live there. So, for most of us, our vote is simply one of many votes.

Or a more macabre note, firing squads are such that one member of the squad is given a blank but no one knows who. In the end, each member of firing squad can claim that they had the blank. How the prisoner died remains a mystery and everyone doing the shooting is insignificant to the result.

Causality can provide a certain amount of significance to our insignificance however it is unclear whether my actions were in fact the cause of the effect. Causality becomes a type of belief and not a fact: our influence on a specific event is very minor and hard to designate.

## Children don't provide Purpose/Goal

Some replies to the HN questions suggested having a family as a way out of being lost. Yes children *could* reduce you chances of being insignificant. The assumption being that the parents of a significant person are themselves significant.

Our parents probably thought the same and look what happened.

Children should not be purpose or goal for someone elses life. Just imagine when that child asks its parent "Why did you have me?" and the answer would be "Because I was seeking a purpose for *my* life". I'll leave the rest up to the imagine of the reader.

Of course having children out of a desire to have a child because you love someone and both which to be parents is something completely different. The child becomes the the *result* of an act of love. The child isn't *responsible* for filling the missing gaps in someone elses life.

## This is really negative and ruined my day

I'm sorry for that. It wasn't (I promise) my intention. However ...

If you believe the world is a sphere going around the sun, then, unfortunately, you should also believe in the insignificancy of your existence. Why? Because both ideas are grounded in science. All I am presenting here are statistics. I would also prefer the world to be flat but no, it isn't and yes, in the big scheme of things, I'm insignificant.

But before we all start worrying about our planetary insignificance, perhaps we should be inspired by the universal insignificance: we are all really *really* **really** universally insignificant and basically everyone equally so. Perhaps we should see this commonality as something unifying.

Conclusion: reduce global insignificance by making one of your fellow insignificant planetary co-inhabitant significant for you.

## What else can I do?

If you read the [comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30230620) you will realise that there are very many approaches to getting over the feeling of being lost. Here's the central point to finding the path out of the labyrinth: you need to find an approach that works for you.

Don't believe the hype and assume that if Joe Blow says he does sport and that helped him - it might not help you. Everyone is different and should take their own approach, the approach that fits to them.

For me it was writing this article, I hope for you, it might be reading this.
